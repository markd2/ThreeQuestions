# Three Questions

I like starting the day asking myself three kinds of questions:

* How did yesterday go?
* Whatcha gonna do today?
* something a bit more open-ended to ponder yesterday and today.

This is a quick and dirty phone program to choose (semi) randomly from different
variants of the first two questions, and a variety of things for the third.

Just three questions when starting the day.  Enjoy a bit of self-reflection and
writing.  Maybe get a notebook and a very nice pen and enjoy some longhand
self-communication.  Namaste.
